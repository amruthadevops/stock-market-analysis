# 📈 Stock Market Analysis Project

This project presents a detailed stock market analysis using Python, leveraging a combination of technical indicators, statistical analysis, and machine learning models to evaluate stock performance and assist in data-driven investment decisions.


##  🧠 Project Objective

To analyze historical stock data using data science techniques in order to uncover trends, apply predictive models, and present actionable insights for investment decisions. This project simulates the workflow of a data analyst tasked with providing market intelligence to stakeholders.
##  📊  Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`, `TA-Lib`, `XGBoost`
- **Techniques Used:**: Time series analysis,

    Technical indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands),

    Feature engineering,

    Classification & Regression Models,

    Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

##  🔍 Key Features

- Data Preprocessing: Missing values handled, date parsing, normalization

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Price trends, volatility analysis, correlation heatmaps
